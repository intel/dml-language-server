# Supported Rules

Below are listed the currently supported rules for linting:

## Spacing
- SpBinop, `sp_binop`: spaces around binary operators except for derefencing operators (dot `a.b` and arrow `a->b` )
- SpTernary, `sp_ternary`: spaces around `?` and `:` in ternary conditional expressions
- SpBraces, `sp_brace`: spaces around braces (`{` and `}`)
- SpPunct, `sp_punct`: spaces after but not before colon, semicolon and comma
- NspFunpar, `nsp_funpar`: no spaces between a function/method name and its opening parenthesis
- NspInparen, `nsp_inparen`: no spaces immediately inside parentheses or brackets
- NspUnary, `nsp_unary`: no spaces between a unary operator and its operand
- NspTrailing, `nsp_trailing`: no spaces between the last token in a line and the corresponding newline `\n`

## Indentation
- **IN1**, `indent_size`: Lines are indented a fixed amount of spaces for each indentation level. Defaults to 4, can be set to a custom value by defining field "indentation_spaces" lint configuration [json file](../../example_files/example_lint_cfg.README)
- **IN2**, `indent_no_tabs`: Tab characters (ASCII 9) should never be used to indent lines
- **IN3**, `indent_code_block`: If the previous line contains an opening brace without corresponding closing brace, the current line should be indented one level more than the previous line
- **IN4**, `indent_closing_brace`: Closing braces at the beginning of a line should be aligned to the corresponding indentation level of the statement that started the code block. A closing brace should only ever appear on the same line as the opening brace, or first on a line
- **IN5**, `indent_paren_expr`: A continuation line that is broken inside a parenthesized expression is indented to line up inside the corresponding parenthesis on the previous line
```
    x = interrupt_disabled || is_intr(interrupt_device,
                                      irq_level);
```
- **IN7**: Any line not indented according to the other indentation rules is indented to same level as the preceding non-empty line (this rule is implicit in implementation of `indent_code_block`)
- **IN9**, `indent_switch_case`: Case labels should be indented at the same level as the switch keyword, statements should be indented one level deeper and not in the same line as the case label
```
    switch (p->what) {
    case Winning:
        b = 1000;
    case Losing:
        b = -1000;
        break;
    default:
        callback();
    }
```
- **IN10**, `indent_empty_loop`: When the body of a while or for loop is left empty, indent the semicolon to the appropriate statement level

```
    for (s = 0; (1 << s) < x; s++)
        ;
```

## Line Length
- **LL1**, `long_lines`: Lines should be kept shorter than 80 characters. This limit can be set to a custom value
